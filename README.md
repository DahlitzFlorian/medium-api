# Medium API #
![black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)
## Description ##
This is an alternative for the standard Medium API. It's developed as the original Medium API does not provide
capabilities for interacting with user specific data such as bookmarks. To provide an alternative API filling those
gaps, a browser imitation has to be used such as Selenium.

## Blocking Issues ##
As Medium uses reCaptcha, the login automation is currently the major
issue. If anybody know a reliable solution to bypass this, feel
free to submit a PR.

## Contribution ##
Contributions are highly welcomed.
